# autocomplete

We are going to "interview" 10 people. 5 novices, 5 experts. 

We will ask users to complete writing 5 different functions in Python (varying order for each user):
  1. Control -- no autocomplete feature here
  2. Press tab to complete word + grayed out in-place (i.e. gmail)
  3. Press right key to complete word + grayed out in-place (i.e. gmail)
  4. Press tab to complete word + list of options below
  5. Press right key to complete word + list of options below
  
The functions we are testing: 
  1. def function1():
    
  2. def function2():
  
  3. def function3():
  
  4. def function4():
  
  5. def function5():
