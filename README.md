# autocomplete

We are going to "interview" 10 people. 5 novices, 5 experts. 

We will ask users to complete writing 5 different functions in Python (varying order for each user):
  1. Control -- no autocomplete feature here
  2. Press tab to complete word + grayed out in-place (i.e. gmail)
  3. Press right key to complete word + grayed out in-place (i.e. gmail)
  4. Press tab to complete word + list of options below
  5. Press right key to complete word + list of options below
  
The functions we are testing will have a function name, for loop, and if else statement: 
  1. Write a function called function1 that, for 0 through 9, prints out "even" if it's even and "odd" if it's odd. 
     def function1():
       for i in range(0, 10):
		      if i % 2 == 0:
			      print("even")
		      else:
			      print("odd")
            
            
  2. def function2():
  
  3. def function3():
  
  4. def function4():
  
  5. def function5():
