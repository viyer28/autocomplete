# autocomplete

We're a group of students running an experiment to test the usability of different autocomplete mechanisms for programmers with various experience levels. We ask that you complete 5 very short functions in Python as you would in a regular code editor. Each function contains the following commonly used keywords: def, for, range, else, print. This experiment is not an assessment of coding ability; rather, for each of these functions, you can autocomplete the aforementioned keywords in your code in 5 different ways. The objective is to figure out which of the following 5 autocomplete methods are most intuitive for users: 

  Function 1: Control -- There is no autocomplete feature here (Type out the function as you normally would).
  Function 2: Press tab to autocomplete a keyword + suggested word will be grayed out in-place. 
  Function 3: Press right arrow key to autocomplete word + suggested word will be grayed out in-place.
  Function 4: Press tab to autocomplete word + suggested words will be listed in a drop-down for you to select.  
  Function 5: Press right arrow key to autocomplete word + suggested words will be listed in a drop-down for you to select.
